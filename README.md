## Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank Redesign

This repository contains the production front-end code for the [open redesign](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/greater-pittsburgh-community-food-bank-open-redesign/) of the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. The front-end code is being assembled with [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) and will eventually be integrated into a Wordpress CMS.
